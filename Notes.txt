Task 2:
Columns Removed:
	- Remove all NaN columns
	- Removed columns with cardinality = 1
	- Removed feature is highly correlated (acc>0.8) with target
	- Removed columns which can be irrelevant like names, ids etc
Preprocessing: 
	- Only one hot encoding

Finally - 6 (5  cat, 1 float) 

Task 3:
a)
Columns Added:
	- Columns with fewer than 50% nulls
Imputation:
	- Constant
Columns Removed:
	- Columns with more than 50% nulls
	- Removed columns which can be irrelevant like names, ids etc
Preprocessing:
	- OHE
	- Scaling

b) 
a) + Imputation = Mode	

c)
b) + Preprocessing
		- Target Encoding
